# This repository is dedicated to various questions and topics in Python.

## Especially, for people who are just starting workitng with Python - I will try to explain different methods, functions, libraries and how to use them in a simple manner. 

## I am aiming to combine theoretical basis and practice. And provide examples. 

### Feel free to take any code and modify it as you wish - any comments or suggestions are welcome. 
 
### Enjoy the lessons.
