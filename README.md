# This repository is dedicated to various questions and topics in Python.

## Especially, for people who are just starting workitng with Python - I will try to explain different methods, functions, libraries and how to use them in simple language. 

## I am aiming to combine theory basis and practice with examples. 

### Feel free to take any code and modify as you wish - any comments or suggestions are welcome. If you find any of my efforts useful please let me know by giving a star - it would be encouraging. 
 
### Enjoy the lessons.
